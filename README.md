# Platzi Live Repo

If we're gonna have a Live coding session why can't we have a temporal repo to host the written code?

This repo will remain open until the last day of February so you can share it to your friends, fork it and even improve it!

If you want to contribute please let me know so maybe we could keep it alive longer than expected.

## Main Goal

Create an Azure DevOps project template with all required features using Terraform.
